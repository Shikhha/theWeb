# Intructions

## Project outline

In this project there will be a side-navigation with a number of page-links that all lead to individual pages with controls that can be automated.

## Details

Each page will have a number of controls, and a message displaying the state of the controls.

THere will also be a part of the page where the state of the control is determined by a random generater. 

The desired state will be displayed in the page, and when the control is manipulated to desired state, it will display "Correct state". 

## Requirements

- As there will be several pages and a side navigation menu, this needs to be created. 
- Basic page responsiveness is also desired (to be displayed in a mobile)
- As a lot of random functionality will be used in several pages, build a separate random utility component
